## Project Steps

1. **Load Data**: Import credit risk dataset and perform EDA.  
2. **Preprocess**: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, remove duplicates.  
3. **Scale Features**: Log-transform skewed data, apply StandardScaler.  
4. **Split Data**: Train-test split with stratified sampling.  
5. **Train Models**: Fit Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest with GridSearchCV.  
6. **Evaluate**: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC; plot ROC curves, confusion matrices.  
7. **Save Model**: Pickle Random Forest model.

## Results

- **Best Model**: Random Forest Classifier  
- **AUC Score**: 0.9308
- **Conclusion**: Random Forest performed best with high recall and balanced accuracy.
